This section documents how rapace is put together and how it is used in the bearcove tooling ecosystem.

## Overview

- [Architecture](architecture.md) – how frames, sessions, and transports fit together
- [Plugins](plugins.md) – building plugins with `rapace-plugin`
- [Motivation](motivation.md) – dodeca's use case and why rapace ended up the way it is
- [Comparisons](comparisons.md) – how this relates to other approaches
- [Future directions](future.md) – ideas that might build on this later

Other pages may be added over time to describe particular components in more detail, but there is no "getting started" or usage tutorial here on purpose. For usage and examples, see the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/rapace) and the [README](https://github.com/bearcove/rapace#readme).
